This system is implemented by PHP + Ajax, with MySQL database. Since I developed it on the CS machines, there is no setup instruction. It's available through cs.dartmouth.edu/~ne/dbphp/main.php.

Thanks to Ajax, this system is able to get rid of tons of annoying pages and their transitions. You'll only see four types of page:
main.php       user login;
customer.php   customer page;
employee.php   employee page;
passengers.php passenger list.

There are other files to provide the functions:
dbcalls.php    to handle xmlhttpresuest and execute sql querys;
sunapeedb.php  TA's file, db obj, modified on my own purpos;
book.php       execute booking stored procedure;
cancel.php     execute cancellation stored procedure;
logout.php     clear up session;
top5.php       execute query to find top 5 flights;
dbstyle.css    TA's file, modified.
