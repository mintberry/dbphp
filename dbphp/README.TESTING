Here are accounts to test customer and employee:
customer: username: 6000011, passwd: NEL30NPQ0HG
employee: username: 5000000, passwd: avafreeman

For more data, please refer to data.sql.

customer: after logging in, you can see your name and a set of links. Each link would expand a table for customer. And for the available flights and future flights, customer can modify data(book and cancel reservations) by clicking on the table entry(one entry each time). The other three tables are read-only. These expanded tables can be collapsed. The seat status are tracked by capacity and occupied attributes, thus only flights with seats left are listed and can then be booked. 

employee: the page looks like that for customers. Past and future flights display the flights with reservations. By clicking on each entry in the flights table, a new page(tab/window) would be opened to list all the passengers on that flight. For top 5 booked flights, employee has to select a date range by a date input(this html5 input works fine only in Chrome and Opera, on other browsers it's just a text input, but also works). The order is based on the departure date of the flight instead of the booking date.
